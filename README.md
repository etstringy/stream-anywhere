## Prerequisites
You will need to install the Rust compiler and the packages in the Cargo.toml file. This should be done automatically for you if you are using an IDE such as Visual Studio Code along with the relevant plugins.

## Running
1. Create a `.env` file and put your bot token into it similar to the `.env.example` file
2. `cargo run`

## Usage
To use the bot, simply paste a Spotify or Apple Music link into a chat that the bot can read messages from and send messages to.
